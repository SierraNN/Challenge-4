# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz
Coding Quiz

At some point in your journey to become a full-stack web developer, you’ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment&mdash;perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

This Challenge invites us to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app runs in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

## Passing Criteria
